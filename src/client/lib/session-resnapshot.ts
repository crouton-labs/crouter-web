/**
 * Cold-start re-snapshot policy (consumed by node-page).
 *
 * A freshly-spawned node whose broker was still booting when the session hub
 * first connected is served a *static* snapshot and never transitions live on
 * its own (the hub's cold-start fallback starts no revive-watch). When the node
 * is actually live (lifecycle `active`) but our stream is stuck on that static
 * snapshot, a bounded socket reconnect re-runs the server's live-vs-static
 * check — the same effect as a manual page reload — and lands the live snapshot
 * once the broker's socket is up. Genuinely-dormant nodes (idle/done/dead/
 * canceled) never qualify, so the explicit Revive path stays untouched.
 *
 * Pure policy so node-page's effect stays a thin orchestrator and the decision
 * is unit-tested.
